### Demo project for practice with React Native.
I developing it using ***[Nuclide IDE](https://nuclide.io)*** under macOS and running  mostly for iOS.
Assume that **Xcode**, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) are installed.

Install [Flow](https://flow.org)
> npm install --global flow-bin@0.46.0

Atom has ESLint support via plugging.  If you want to have nice diagnostic in your code just install [linter-eslint plugging](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint). Project has all configuration for it. 

Clone project:
> git clone git@github.com:3a4oT/reactNativeAlbums.git

Go to project dir:
> cd reactNativeAlbums

Install all dependencies:
> npm install

Run in iOS simulator
> react-native run-ios


#### My Goals:

- play with [Flow](https://flow.org), [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [ESLint](http://eslint.org).
- use and learn hotkeys for [Nuclide (IDE by FaceBook)](https://nuclide.io)
- learn the basics of React, Redux, RactNative.
- play with networking.
- try to be cross-platform.
- learn how to write unit tests for ReactNative application.
- set up Travis CI.
- learn how to integrate. ReactNative into existing native codebase.
